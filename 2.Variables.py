# Variables: these are used to store your data in python or hold your data
# like in maths where we used x = 10 or y = 9, variables are same here in python too
#learning to name variables:

name = 'sanket' #using albhabet is valid
user_id = 2 # using uderscore (_) to seperate words is valid
num1 = 23 # using number after is valid

# but

'''
we cannot use these:
- 1name = 'sanket'(a variable name cannot start with a number)
- last name = 'shrestha'(we cannot leave space in name called white space)
